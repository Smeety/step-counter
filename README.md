# Step Counter
A plugin for RuneLite that counts how many steps your character takes.

To set the step goal, go to the configuration tab for Step Counter and set the goal you want.

To reset the counter, close and reopen RuneLite. I'm not sure how to reset it otherwise.

If you hit your goal, you'll be congratulated, yay!
